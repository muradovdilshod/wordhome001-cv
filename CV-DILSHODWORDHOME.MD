### Briefly About Myself:

Having started my career as a layout designer in local neewspaper with minimum skills, I became profficient in printing  design .

My keen interest in printing technolgies led me to working as a Prepress and DTP Engineer in the largest printing house in my city,

where I continued self-lerning, examining the process of creating wine and food labels, magazines and other printed goods.


Remote work as a retoucher gives me extra free time, which I spend leaning Frontend Development.

I'm interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professioonal growth,

besides there's a huge amount of free high quality resources for self education and a large community of developers.

I belive, that my abilty to learning and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
